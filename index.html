    <h1>BUTTERFLY</h1>
    <h1><img src="butterfly.jpg" width=300 height=300> </h1>

    <ul>
    <li>This origami butterfly is absolutely beautiful and looks even better with nice origami paper.</l1> 
     <li>The wings spread out nicely and the body comes up a little to give it a more realistic look.</li> 
     <li>The head adds another dimension of realism and if you like,</li>
     <li>you can make and attach some antennas for a more complete look.</li>
</ul>
 <h2>DRAGON</h2>
 <h2><img src="dragon.jpg" width=300 height=300></h2>
 <ul>
     <li>Origami Dragons are very individual creatures.,</li>
    <li>Due to the many complexities of their wings and horns,</li>   
    <li>Origami Dragons are able to contort their bodies in a specific form that is unique to them.</li>   
     <li>While adult Origami Dragons may look the same at a base level,</li> 
    <li>no two are exactly alike.</li>
 </ul>
